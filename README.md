  ## Flowchart

![Wireframe](media/flowchart.png)

I designed a basic flowchart on [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) first.This was to give me a template to follow and to make sure my original design that I had planned was the outcome and final layout of the application. This was an essential piece to the over all project as it helped me keep track of how the application would be displayed to the user and the steps the user would take within the application.
